# ICSim-exploitation-tool  
A simple tool I made as an assignment. It can be used on the Instrument Cluster Simulator from zombieCraig.  
  
Usage is straightforward, type help to list available commands.  
After entering a command neccesary information on how to use it will be displayed.  
  
Workflow:  
Playing around with the controls to get a feel on how things work  
Sniffing can traffic  
Filtering based on IDs, using built in tools (looked at the original sourcecode and Ive seen the macros being defined, it may be cheating but couldnt be unseen)  
Fuzzing  
Experimenting with possible exploitation methods using modified replays and cansend  
Writing code to automate (sublime)  
  
Notes:  
Setting the speed uses an infinite loop, so execution gets stuck. Didnt want to spend time on implementing threads.  
Didnt clean code after it was done so it might be a bit hectic, but tried to make clarifying comments during development.
